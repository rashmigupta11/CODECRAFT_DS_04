# 📝 Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes public sentiment from tweets and classifies them as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** using machine learning and deep learning models.

---

## 🔍 Overview

We built a sentiment analysis model trained on real tweets to understand how people feel about various topics. This can help companies track public opinion, feedback, and trends.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- Used a Kaggle dataset with tweets and labeled sentiments.
- Cleaned and preprocessed data by removing noise, mentions, and special characters.

## 🧪 Key Steps

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature Extraction (TF-IDF, tokenization)  
- Model Training (Logistic Regression, SVM, Deep Learning)  
- Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)  
- Visualization (confusion matrix, sentiment distribution)

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  
- Transformers  
- PyTorch
